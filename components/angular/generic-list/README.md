# Generic List Component

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You will see a sandbox app that uses <y-generic-table> & <y-generic-list> componets from the embedded list.module.ts.

## Build the sandbox app

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
